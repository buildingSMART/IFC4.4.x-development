Project Declaration
===================

The project provides a directory of object types and property templates contained within using declaration relationships.

> NOTE The actual object occurrences used within the context of a project, such as walls, beams, air outlets, are assigned to a spatial hierarchy that is linked to the project using the aggregation hierarchy. See concept _Spatial Decomposition_ for linking a spatial structure to the project.

> HISTORY New concept template enabled by schema enhancements in IFC4.
