Helmert Transition Segment
==========================

The Helmert transition segment is a special case of a fourth order spiral where the curvature rate of change is a quadratic function and the terms are dependent on the length L measured from the inflection point. The parameter value is defined as the deflection i.e. bearing angle &Theta.

The terms for the first half of the segment:
QuadraticTerm = L/√2
rest are 0.

Terms for the second half of the segment:
QuadraticTerm =  -L/√2
LinearTerm = L/4
Constant = -1

_SegmentStart_ is the bearing angle at start and _SegmentLength_ is the bearing angle at the end of the segment.
