Cosine Spiral Transition Segment
================================

The cosine spiral transition segment is a special case of a spiral where the curvature rate of change is a cosine function and the terms are dependent on the length L measured from the inflection point. The parameter value is defined as the deflection i.e. bearing angle &Theta.

The values of its individual terms dependent on segment length L:
CosineTerm = L
ConstantTerm = 1

concept {
    IfcCurveSegment:ParentCurve -> IfcCosineSpiral
    IfcCurveSegment:SegmentStart -> IfcLengthMeasure_0
    IfcCurveSegment:SegmentLength -> IfcLengthMeasure_1
    IfcCosineSpiral:CosineTerm -> IfcLengthMeasure
    IfcCosineSpiral:ConstantTerm -> IfcReal
}
```
